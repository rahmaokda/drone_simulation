# drone_simulation
This project implements an autonomous drone navigation system. The drone takes off, follows a series of predefined GPS waypoints, and continuously monitors its battery levels. If the battery level is low, it automatically returns to the launch point. In case of a critical battery level, the drone performs an emergency landing to prevent crashes.
